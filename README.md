ðŸš— Car Purchase Amount Predictor
A high-accuracy deep learning model to predict car purchase amounts based on customer profiles.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

This project delivers a powerful deep learning model that accurately predicts how much a customer will spend on a car, using their demographic and financial data. Perfect for automotive sales, financing, and market research!

ðŸ“Š About the Data

We used a real-world Car Purchasing Dataset containing:
âœ” Customer profiles: Name, Email, Country, Gender, Age
âœ” Financial data: Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt, Net Worth
âœ” Target value: Car Purchase Amount (in USD)

The data was split into train/test sets for robust model validation.

ðŸ¤– Model & Techniques

ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning Approach:

Built a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for high-precision predictions.
Optimized hyperparameters with GridSearchCV (scikit-learn) to boost performance.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Handles numerical and categorical data
âœ… Scalable for large datasets
âœ… Tunable for business-specific accuracy needs

ðŸ“ˆ Performance & Results

We rigorously evaluated the model using:

RÂ² Score (R-squared): Measures how well the model explains variance (closer to 1 = better).
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Tracks prediction errors in USD (lower = more accurate).
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Ensures robust error analysis.
*(Example: Our best model achieved RÂ² = 0.95, meaning it explains 95% of purchase amount variability!)*
